## Data-Strucute: Collection Framework

   * A Stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) principle. Stack has one end, whereas the Queue has two ends (front and rear). 
   * It contains only one pointer top pointer pointing to the topmost element of the stack.
   * Whenever an element is added in the stack, it is added on the top of the stack, and the element can be deleted only from the stack. In other words, a stack can be defined as a container in which insertion and deletion can be done from the one end known as the top of the stack.

### Standard Stack Operations
 The following are some common operations implemented on the stack:

* push(): When we insert an element in a stack then the operation is known as a push. If the stack is full then the overflow condition occurs.
* pop(): When we delete an element from the stack, the operation is known as a pop. If the stack is empty means that no element exists in the stack, this state is known as an underflow state.
* isEmpty(): It determines whether the stack is empty or not.
* isFull(): It determines whether the stack is full or not.'
* peek(): It returns the element at the given position.
* count(): It returns the total number of elements available in a stack.
* change(): It changes the element at the given position.
* display(): It prints all the elements available in the stack.
